# Basic Java Console Application

A beginner-friendly Java console application with detailed comments explaining fundamental Java concepts.

## What This Program Demonstrates

- **Class Structure**: How to define a Java class
- **Main Method**: The entry point of a Java application
- **Variables**: Different data types (int, double, String, boolean, char)
- **User Input**: Reading input from the console using Scanner
- **Basic Calculations**: Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- **Methods**: Creating and calling custom methods
- **Conditionals**: Using if-else statements
- **Loops**: Using for loops to repeat code

## How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer
- You can check if Java is installed by running: `java -version` in your terminal/command prompt

### Steps

1. **Compile the Java file:**
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```
   This creates a `Main.class` file (bytecode that Java can execute)

2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
   This executes the compiled program

### Example Output

The program will:
- Display welcome messages
- Show examples of different variable types
- Ask for your name and age
- Perform calculations with two numbers
- Check if a number is even or odd
- Count from 1 to 5

## Learning Tips

1. Read through the comments in the code - they explain what each part does
2. Try modifying the code to see what happens
3. Experiment with different values and inputs
4. Add your own methods and features

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with this program, try:
- Adding more methods
- Creating arrays
- Working with different loop types (while, do-while)
- Handling exceptions
- Creating multiple classes
